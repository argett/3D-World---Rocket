This project is a M1 scholar project that we had to do in pair.

The team is composed by Adrien CHAHINIAN (git : adrienpj) and Lilian FAVRE GARCIA (git : argett)

The purpose of this project was to create a short "game" which had to be played in a virtual reality world. Considering a learning aspect, we had to create something quite funny but with a simulation aspect too.

This project is made on Unity3D.
